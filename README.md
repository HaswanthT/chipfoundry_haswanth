# 🔐 Crypto Accelerator for Microwatt  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project proposes a **hardware cryptographic accelerator** integrated with the open-source **Microwatt POWER CPU core**.  
The accelerator will implement **AES-128 encryption/decryption** in Verilog, providing a **secure and high-performance solution** for open computing systems.  

By offloading cryptographic operations to hardware, this design demonstrates **significant performance improvements** compared to software-only implementations, while showcasing the flexibility of Microwatt as a foundation for custom extensions.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Design and implement an **AES-128 crypto core in Verilog**.  
- Provide a **Wishbone/AXI-lite memory-mapped interface** for Microwatt integration.  
- Demonstrate secure and fast data encryption/decryption on Microwatt.  
- Ensure the design is **open-source, reproducible, and SKY130-compatible**.
